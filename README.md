# Practice-Website
This will be a vanilla JS website with no framework used. I plan to become proficient at Vue.JS and other Front and Back end frameworks, however, first I must learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. 

Here are some screenshots of the website, I plan to create another page with either a tic tac toe or checkers game written in JS.

The features it currently has is a dropdown menu, flexible grid navbar, a Javascript written function which changes the backround color, and another page which generates (really grabs from anm array) random psuedo text/lorem Ipsum.
